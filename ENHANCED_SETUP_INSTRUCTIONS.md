# Music Stream Matcher - Enhanced Setup Instructions

## 🎵 New Features

Your Music Stream Matcher has been **significantly enhanced** with:

- **YouTube Music Integration**: Find tracks on both Spotify and YouTube Music
- **Modular Architecture**: Easy to add new music services in the future
- **Dual Service Support**: See results from multiple platforms simultaneously
- **Enhanced UI**: Clean display of all available music service options

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. API Configuration

#### Spotify API Setup (Required)
1. Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard)
2. Create a new app and get your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Open `Sources/SpotifyServiceProvider.swift` and replace:
   ```swift
   private let clientId = "YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID"
   private let clientSecret = "YOUR_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET"
   ```

#### YouTube Music API Setup (Optional but Recommended)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the **YouTube Data API v3**
4. Create credentials (API Key)
5. Open `Sources/YouTubeMusicServiceProvider.swift` and replace:
   ```swift
   private let apiKey = "YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY"
   ```

### 2. Build and Run

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/christian.smith/github/weekend-projects/music-stream-matcher

# Build the enhanced application
swift build

# Run the application
./.build/debug/MusicStreamMatcher
```

## 🎯 New User Experience

### Enhanced Menu Bar Interface

When you click the menu bar icon, you'll now see:

1. **Current Track Info**: Shows what's playing in Apple Music
2. **Multi-Service Results**: Displays matches from all configured services
3. **Service-Specific Actions**: 
   - **Spotify**: "Open in Spotify" and "Copy Spotify Link"
   - **YouTube Music**: "Open in YouTube Music" and "Copy YouTube Link"
4. **Smart Fallbacks**: If one service fails, others still work

### Example Menu Structure
```
♪ Song Title - Artist Name
   from Album Name
─────────────────────────
🎵 Found on Spotify
   Open in Spotify
   Copy Spotify Link
─────────────────────────
🎵 Found on YouTube Music  
   Open in YouTube Music
   Copy YouTube Link
─────────────────────────
Refresh
─────────────────────────
Quit
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Modular Design
- **Protocol-Based**: Easy to add new music services
- **Concurrent Searching**: All services search simultaneously
- **Clean Separation**: Each service is independent
- **Scalable**: Add Apple Music, Tidal, etc. easily

### Service Providers
- **SpotifyServiceProvider**: Handles Spotify Web API
- **YouTubeMusicServiceProvider**: Handles YouTube Data API
- **MusicServiceManager**: Coordinates all providers

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Service Priority
Services are searched concurrently, but you can modify the order in `MusicServiceProvider.swift`:

```swift
private func setupProviders() {
    providers.append(SpotifyServiceProvider())
    providers.append(YouTubeMusicServiceProvider())
    // Add more services here
}
```

### Search Behavior
- **Exact Search**: Tries title + artist + album first
- **Fallback Search**: Uses title + artist if exact fails
- **Smart Matching**: Filters out covers, remixes, karaoke versions

## 🎵 Adding New Music Services

The modular architecture makes it easy to add new services:

1. **Create a new provider** conforming to `MusicServiceProvider`
2. **Implement search methods** for the service's API
3. **Add to MusicServiceManager** in the `setupProviders()` method

Example structure:
```swift
class AppleMusicServiceProvider: MusicServiceProvider {
    let serviceName = "Apple Music"
    var isConfigured: Bool { /* check credentials */ }
    
    func searchTrack(title: String, artist: String, album: String) async throws -> MusicServiceResult? {
        // Implement Apple Music search
    }
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### No Results from YouTube Music
- Verify your YouTube Data API key is correct
- Check API quotas in Google Cloud Console
- Ensure the API key has YouTube Data API v3 enabled

### No Results from Spotify
- Verify Client ID and Client Secret are correct
- Check your Spotify app is not in Development Mode
- Ensure you have internet connectivity

### App Performance
- The app searches both services concurrently for speed
- Results appear as soon as each service responds
- Failed services don't block successful ones

### API Limits
- **Spotify**: 100 requests per minute (generous for personal use)
- **YouTube**: 10,000 units per day (each search ~100 units)

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

The modular architecture enables easy addition of:
- **Apple Music API** (when available)
- **Tidal Integration**
- **SoundCloud Support**
- **Bandcamp Integration**
- **Custom Streaming Services**
